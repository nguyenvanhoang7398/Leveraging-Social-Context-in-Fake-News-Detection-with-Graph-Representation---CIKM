----- TEXT:
The authors propose an inductive graphical neural network framework for fake news detection. The proposed framework leverages GraphSage to learn the representation of each social entity, which is further combined with time and stance as engagement for Bi-LSTM with attention mechanism.

Fake news detection is a widely concerned problem. The motivation is clear and the proposed methodology is meaningful. It is a well-written paper with good structure and clear problem definition. The experiment based on a public dataset is comprehensive and promising. Especially, the idea of introducing time into consideration, is novel and reasonable. Also, it is nice to adopt GraphSage for addressing the problem that transductive graph neural networks are unable to deal with unseen nodes. This is a high-quality paper that should be accepted.

However, there are some problems might weaken the quality of this paper.
It is claimed at Abstract that FANG is efficient at inference time, but there is nowhere in the paper about the discussion of inference time.
When digging into the two examples at Section 5.4, it is unclear why FANG pays most of its attention to a tweet by user B or user C. In other words, it would be nice to provide some solid evidences such as experiment data to illustrate.
Lastly, it would have been informative to give a clearer algorithm design introduction.

----- TEXT:
In this paper the authors propose an inductive graph neural network approach fake news detection.  The graph seems to contain several node types such as users, news, sources and different link types.

Then an inductive graph embedding technique graphsage is used for learning representations. Then network is trained by combining several losses such as stance detection and fake news loss.

The paper is well written and easy to follow. However following limitations if addressed could become stronger.

1. While the stance detection based on user comments are considered, external clues/evidence to disprove a claim is not considered. For example, in social networks typically social echo chambers are where the fake news spreads and those users ideologically agree with each other. However, there could be credible evidence elsewhere in news or scientific articles which is curicial for fact checking and identifying false claims made on social networks.
2. More stronger baselines could be used. CSI and GCN seems to be in a disadvantage because they do not have access to all the features
3. When GraphSage was used for training, does it respect the direction of the edges? especially with user follow relationship in Twitter it is often unidirectional.
4. Another issue is there should be some ablation study. In practice it is hard to expect availability of all the features used in the paper. It would be useful to know how robust is the model when som eof the features such as user interaction or stance information are missing.

Some minor issues:

In section 5.3 Figure reference is missing
Figure 3 could be a bit bigger.

----- TEXT:
The authors propose FANG, which they call a 'novel' graphical context representation and learning platform for fake news detection and source-factual prediction. Their proposed method represents and uses the social media entities (news sources, posts, and users and the interactions among them). In this work, the authors focus on representation learning. The paper shows a good understanding of the mathematical and technical backgrounds of the proposed solution. Reasonable limitations and future works are discussed. I enjoyed reading it, and I believe it has a noticeable improvement in the field.

Sides to improve in this work:
The stance-annotated dataset is not well distributed between the train and test sets for the News.
Related work can be improved by considering more of recent-works, especially for the GNN part. Also, the Popat references [30] and [31] are listed in the table but not discussed in the related work.
There is a gap of 10% in the total attention from FANG for the real news.
The language of the paper can be enhanced by removing some typos and improve the sentence to make it more transparent. Also, there are some typos (below are the ones I catch):
Page 1 textiti.e.
Page 2 a Euclidean transformation
Page 3 as well as its of its underlying
Page 4 inn order
Page 5, Table 4 has a repeated row.
Page 8, ?? appears instead of the figure number.
